Open Street Maps (OSM) to CommonRoad Conversion
###############################################

This conversion allows you to convert road networks from the
`OpenStreetMap (OSM) format <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ format to the CommonRoad format (2020a).

Quick Start Guide
*****************

Command Line Interface
========================

Want to quickly convert an OSM file detailing an OSM map to a XML file with a CommonRoad scenario?

Use the command
``crdesigner osm -i input-file.osm -o output-file.xml``.

For example ``crdesigner osm -i test.osm -o new_converted_file_name.xml``
produces a file called *new_converted_file_name.xml*

.. note::
   If no output file name is specified, the converted file will be called input-file.xml,
   e.g. ``crdesigner opendrive -i test.osm`` produces a file called *test.xml*.

Or use the GUI with the command
``crdesigner`` or ``crdesigner gui``.

Note that you have to activate the Python environment in which the CommonRoad Scenario Designer is installed first to
use the command line.

Python APIs
==========================================

.. code:: python

    import os

    from crdesigner.io.api import osm_to_commonroad

    from commonroad.scenario.scenario import Tag
    from commonroad.common.file_writer import CommonRoadFileWriter, OverwriteExistingFile
    from commonroad.planning.planning_problem import PlanningProblemSet

    import crdesigner.conversion.osm2cr.converter_modules.converter as converter
    import crdesigner.conversion.osm2cr.converter_modules.cr_operations.export as ex
    from crdesigner.conversion.osm2cr import config
    from crdesigner.conversion.osm2cr.converter_modules.osm_operations.downloader import download_around_map

    # download a map
    download_around_map(config.BENCHMARK_ID + '_downloaded.osm', 48.140289, 11.566272)

    # --------------------------------------- Option 1: General API ------------------------------------------
    # load OSM file, parse it, and convert it to a CommonRoad scenario
    scenario = osm_to_commonroad(config.SAVE_PATH + config.BENCHMARK_ID + ".osm")

    # store converted file as CommonRoad scenario
    writer = CommonRoadFileWriter(
        scenario=scenario,
        planning_problem_set=PlanningProblemSet(),
        author="Sebastian Maierhofer",
        affiliation="Technical University of Munich",
        source="CommonRoad Scenario Designer",
        tags={Tag.URBAN},
    )
    writer.write_to_file(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) + "/" + "ZAM_OSM-1_1-T1.xml",
                         OverwriteExistingFile.ALWAYS)


    # ----------------------------------- Option 2: OSM conversion APIs --------------------------------------

    # open the map and convert it to a scenario
    scenario = converter.GraphScenario(config.SAVE_PATH + config.BENCHMARK_ID + ".osm")

    # draw and show the scenario
    scenario.plot()

    # save the scenario as commonroad file
    scenario.save_as_cr(config.SAVE_PATH + config.BENCHMARK_ID + ".xml")
    # save the scenario as a binary
    scenario.save_to_file(config.SAVE_PATH + config.BENCHMARK_ID + ".pickle")

    # view the generated
    ex.view_xml(config.SAVE_PATH + config.BENCHMARK_ID + ".xml")

In order to use the API calls, the save_path and Benchmark_ID has to be set in the config file. 
The config file can be found at */crdesigner/conversion/osm2cr* and is described in detail at the end of this document.

The GUI provides also functionality to edit already the OSM graph structure before converting to CommonRoad.

Implementation Details
**********************

Format differences
==================

OpenStreetMap (OSM) files and CommonRoad (CR) scenarios are formats that can both represent road networks with
additional elements. While they both use XML to be stored on disk the internal structure has many differences.
We will only look at the ones important for the conversion.

Firstly the road network in OSM is basically a graph with nodes and edges. One edge represents a road.
Compared to CR here we have lanelets and information about intersections.
The coordinates (GPS) in OSM are rough and the amount of points per road section is much smaller.
To accomplish the conversion we have to use heuristics and interpolation for guessing the reality behind the data.

OSM also contains other elements like traffic signs. All this information is stored in so called tags or relations.
With CR version 2020.2 new elements are inserted into the scenario format:
Traffic Signs and Traffic Lights.

.. Conversion Overview
.. ===================

.. Extremely simplified the conversion process works as follows:

.. .. image::
..  images/OSM_control_flow.png
..  :width: 500

.. The program takes a OSM file as input and parses it into the internel representation (graph).
.. The refine the coordinate the user can adjust the graph with the GUI tool **EdgeEdit**.

.. .. image::
..  images/example_edgeedit.png
..  :width: 500

.. Afterwards the each edge that is representing a road with multiple lanes is split into these lane so that there is
.. exactely one edge per lane. As intersection are only single points in OSM the lanes are cut of with a specific
.. radius around the intersection and linked together again. This linking can be adjusted
.. with the GUI tool **LaneLinkEdit**.

..  images/example_lanelinkedit.png
..  :width: 500


When does the automated conversion work?
****************************************

This tool was originally created to automatically convert OSM files to CommonRoad scenarios.
Unfortunately, the tool is not capable to convert all kinds scenarios.
This is because of the fundamental difference of the two formats.
OSM only describes the rough course of a street while CR depicts the boundaries of each drivable lane.
Especially the representation of intersections differs, as they are only points in OSM, while CR files contain all
lanes, connecting the streets across the intersection.
The missing information is generated by the tool following many heuristics and modifiable parameters.
In many cases it is necessary to adjust these parameters or guide the tool by hand instead of relying on the heuristics.

Please be always aware, that the automated tool generates only realistic scenarios, which do not fit reality perfectly.
**Do not use them as maps for autonomous vehicles if you did not review them by hand!**


Scenarios That Will Work Well
=============================
There are many scenarios for which the automated conversion will perform well.
For example motorways and highways, which do not have complicated intersections will be converted quite reliably.
Roads with few lanes, low curvature and far apart intersections, such as parking lots,
will also be converted correctly most times.

A few positive examples can be seen in the following:

.. image::
 images/positive_1.png
 :width: 500

Simple straight roads intersecting.

.. image::
 images/positive_2.png
 :width: 500

A larger intersection with many lanes.

.. image::
 images/positive_3.png
 :width: 500

An example for a small town.

.. image::
 images/positive_4.png
 :width: 500

A simple roundabout.

.. image::
 images/motorway.png
 :width: 500

A large motorway intersection. Please note that tunnels are not supported yet.

.. image::
 images/motorway_2.png
 :width: 500

A motorway access. Please note that tunnels are not supported yet.

Problematic Scenarios
=====================
The conversion process can fail because of various reasons.
Problematic occurrences we experienced repeatedly are listed in the following.

Faulty OSM Data
---------------
Relying on solely OSM data for the generation of a scenario causes the tool to be extremely prone to incomplete and
faulty OSM data.
This seems obvious, but it is easy to overlook small flaws that will cause the result to be surprisingly erroneous.
For example, it occurs frequently, that small segments of roads do not have lane count information.
This causes the result to have a different count of lanes for these small segments as visible in the following example:

.. image::
 images/munich_20_osm.png
 :width: 500

OSM file

.. image::
 images/munich_20_result.png
 :width: 500

CR result

To overcome this issue, it will be easiest to correct the OSM data, for example with the tool
`JOSM <https://josm.openstreetmap.de/>`_.
If the info about lane counts is just missing and not wrong, you can also edit the **LANECOUNTS** Parameter in
**config.py**, to lead the tool to choose the correct count by default.



Large Intersections
-------------------
Linking lanes across intersections in a reasonable manner becomes exponentially more difficult for intersections of
many streets.
We therefore did only build detailed heuristics for intersections with up to four streets (segments of roads that lead
to the intersection) involved.
For larger intersection, there is a fallback heuristic, which might work well if all streets have only one lane per
direction but will most likely produce insufficient results otherwise.

Example:

.. image::
 images/large_intersection.png
 :width: 500

The linking of lanes across intersections can be guided by hand in the GUI of this tool.

Narrow Winding Streets
----------------------
The tool creates the course of lanes by offsetting the central course of roads.
This offsetting procedure will not work well for wide roads with tight curves.

Example:

.. image::
 images/garching_27_osm.png
 :width: 500

OSM file

.. image::
 images/garching_27_result.png
 :width: 500

CR result

This problem occurs rarely and usually only concerns very small streets, for example the driveways of an underground
car park.
If you nonetheless need to depict such streets in CR, you can try to model the course accurately in the
**Edge Edit GUI**.


Streets Running Close Together
------------------------------

Streets are cropped at intersections to leave space for the turning lanes on the intersection.
By default, they are cropped until they have at least a certain distance to all other streets.
When two roads are running closely together, it can happen that both of them are cropped far wider than necessary.
This results in oddly long turning lanes.

Example:

.. image::
 images/close_roads.png
 :width: 500

If you encounter this problem, try to set the parameter **INTERSECTION_CROPPING_WITH_RESPECT_TO_ROADS** in **config.py**
to **False**.
Then the tool will crop roads until a certain distance to the center of the intersection.


Very Complicated Scenarios
--------------------------

There are several factors, which can make a scenario complicated.
We see most problems when there are many large intersections (containing many lanes/streets) close together.
In such cases many things can go wrong.

Example:

.. image::
 images/complex_osm.png
 :width: 500

OSM file

.. image::
 images/complex.png
 :width: 500

CR result

We advice to use the GUI for such scenarios and pay close attention to every street segment.
If you are doing that, it is also helpful to set the parameter **DELETE_SHORT_EDGES** in **config.py**
to **False**.
This will prevent the tool from deleting road segments it considers as too short, as they can be reviewed in the GUI.
In some cases it might still be necessary, to create at least parts of the scenario by hand.

Left Hand Traffic
-----------------

The tool assumes right hand traffic for all scenarios.


External Data Sources
*********************

Geonames Scenario Infos
=======================

`Geonames <https://www.geonames.org/>`_ is a free database that contains information (such as population density) about over eleven million places worldwide. 
When providing a Geonames username in the **config.py**, a Geonames ID will be stored in a scenario. 
This ID can be later on used to retrieve further location information about the scenario.


Mapillary Traffic Signs
=======================

Additionally to traffic signs from the given .osm file, the converter is also able to use **Mapillary** as an external source of signs.
Mapillary is an open source community mapping tool, that provides more detailed insights in road networks based on real camera footage.
In order to request data from Mapillary, an API key is needed, which can be obtained from `Mapillary.com <https://www.mapillary.com/>`_.
The key has to be saved in the **config.py** file.

Since Mapillary is only providing the coordinates of each detected traffic sign, signs are added to the lanelet with the closest distance.
This strategy can sometimes lead to traffic signs that are not correctly placed in the final scenario. 
A manual review is therefore recommended.

It is also possible change the behavior how traffic signs are added to the scenario using **config.py** file.
For example, Mapillary can be used as single source for traffic signs or several filters can be applied on signs.
