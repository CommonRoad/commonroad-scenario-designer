Installation
############

Recommended Installation
************************

Prerequisites
*************
Install library commonroad-io: https://gitlab.lrz.de/cps/commonroad-io 

Install library Sumo-Interface: https://gitlab.lrz.de/cps/sumo-interface/-/tree/develop

Make sure to checkout the branch develop.

Manual Installation
*******************
When manually installing this tool, you need to install it's dependencies via you package manager. 
Currently we provide validated installation steps **only for Ubuntu >= 18.04**.

A fully working setup requires installation of all the following dependencies.

Partial Installation
====================
When you just want to try the map conversion, but **not** simulate traffic on the resulting scenarios,
it suffices to just install the following requirements:

You need to firstly install ``cartopy`` either using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge cartopy

**or** install the required libs manually (tested only on ubuntu 18:04)

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install -y libproj-dev proj-data proj-bin libgeos++-dev gcc g++  # Cartopy dependencies
  apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx # PyQt dependencies

Then install the python dependencies as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/cps/commonroad-map-tool.git
  cd commonroad-map-tool
  # install the requirements
  pip install -r requirements.txt

However this also hides all SUMO related features from the GUI. For a full installation see the following section.

Full installation
=================
SUMO is required for simulating vehicle on a CommonRoad Scenario. Firstly it's dependencies need to be installed:


Activate your python environment (Version >= 3.6):

.. code-block:: bash

  conda activate commonroad

Install our patched SUMO Version from `GitHub <https://github.com/octavdragoi/sumo>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  # install system requirements (ubuntu)
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  # Install SUMO
  git clone https://github.com/octavdragoi/sumo
  cd sumo
  git checkout smooth-lane-change
  sudo apt-get install -y cmake python g++ libxerces-c-dev libfox-1.6-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgl2ps-dev swig
  export SUMO_HOME="$(pwd)"
  echo "export SUMO_HOME=$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j8 # this will take some time
  cd $HOME

**OR** if you don't want the smooth lane change install the stable version of `SUMO <https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
  export SUMO_HOME="/usr/share/sumo"
  # add $SUMO_HOME to .bashrc (change if you're not using bash)
  echo "export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo" >> ~/.bashrc
  cd $HOME

Install `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge cartopy

Install the python requirements at the root of the project:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/cps/commonroad-map-tool.git
  cd commonroad-map-tool
  # install the requirements
  pip install -r requirements.txt
