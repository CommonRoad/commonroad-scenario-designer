CommonRoad Scenario Designer
======================================

The CommonRoad Scenario Designer provides a toolbox for creating and manipulating CommonRoad maps
and scenarios as well as converting maps between different map formats.
The CommonRoad Scenario Designer can convert from the Lanelet/Lanelet2, OpenDRIVE, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and SUMO
formats to the CommonRoad format.
Additionally, we provide conversions from the CommonRoad map format to the SUMO and Lanelet format.
We provide a graphical user interface (GUI), command line interface, and different APIs.
