CommonRoad Map-Converter documentation
=============================================
This documentation summarizes the different map converters in this repository.
It consists of the individual converter documentations from the original repositories.
The documentation is currently not up-to-date and not consistent since it
should only serve as an overview about the different converters until the new CommonRoad Map-Converter is finished.
