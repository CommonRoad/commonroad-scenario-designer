CommonRoad Scenario Designer
======================================

The CommonRoad Scenario Designer provides algorithms and interfaces for creating and manipulating CommonRoad maps
and scenarios as well as converting maps between several map formats.
The CommonRoad Scenario Designer can convert from the Lanelet/Lanelet2, OpenDRIVE, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and SUMO
formats to the CommonRoad format.
Additionally, we provide conversions from the CommonRoad map format to the SUMO and Lanelet map format.
We provide a graphical user interface (GUI), command line interface, and different APIs.
