  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s
  Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

  # with overline, for parts
  * for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections
  " for paragraphs


Development

Continuous Integration
**********************

Continuous Integration is handled for the project using `GitLab runners <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/>`_. 
All configuration for which is in ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` found in the project root. Here all stages of the build
and test process can be changed according to the `GitLab CI Syntax <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html>`_.

Docker Image
=============

As a base image for the build process we use the docker image found in ``ci/Dockerfile`` which contains a full
installation of the project. It includes multiple conda environments with python versions installed ranging from python 3.6 to 3.8.
You can run the docker container as follows: 

.. code-block:: bash

  # this will take some time (45 min)
  docker build -t commonroad ci/Dockerfile 
  docker run -it commonroad
  # activate python 3.6
  (commonroad-py38) cruser@70474a0ef635: conda activate commonroad-py36
  # activate python 3.7
  (commonroad-py38) cruser@70474a0ef635: conda activate commonroad-py37
  # activate python 3.8
  (commonroad-py38) cruser@70474a0ef635: conda activate commonroad-py38



However each of the python environments only has the bare minimum dependencies installed.
From then you can install clone / mount the commonroad-map-tool repo and install the missing dependencies with:

.. code-block:: bash

  (commonroad-py38) cruser@70474a0ef635:~/commonroad-map-tool$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Prebuild Images
---------------

We also provide a prebuild version of the aforementioned docker image `here <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rasaford/commonroad-map-tool>`_.
You can run it with:

You can run any of the versions above with:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it rasaford/commonroad-map-tool:VERSION

Replacing ``VERSION`` with the latest version of the docker image.
