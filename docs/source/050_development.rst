  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s
  Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

  # with overline, for parts
  * for chapters
  = for sections
  - for subsections
  ^ for subsubsections
  " for paragraphs

Continuous Integration
**********************

Continuous Integration is handled for the project using `GitLab runners <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/>`_. 
All configuration for which is in ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` found in the project root. Here all stages of the build
and test process can be changed according to the `GitLab CI Syntax <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html>`_.

Docker Images
=============

As a base image for the build process we use one docker image found in ``CI/Dockerfile`` which contains a full
installation of the project. Additionally you can specify the python version to use, when building 
the image like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.7 -t commonroad-map-tool .

Using the above command, a build environment will be created with the Python version specified in ``PYTHON_VERSION``.
But beware building the environment might take quite some time. 
Therefore we also provide pre-built versions at:

- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rasaford/commonroad-map-tool-py36
- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rasaford/commonroad-map-tool-py37

You can run any of the versions above with:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it rasaford/commonroad-map-tool-PY_VERSION:VERSION

Replacing ``PYVERSION`` with the desired python version, e.g. ``py37`` and replacing ``VERSION`` with the latest version of the docker image.
